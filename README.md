```python
import numpy as np

class QuantumSimulator:
    def __init__(self, num_qubits):
        self.num_qubits = num_qubits
        self.state = np.zeros(2**num_qubits, dtype=np.complex128)
        self.state[0] = 1.0  # Initialize with the |0...0⟩ state

    def apply_gate(self, gate, target_qubits):
        gate_matrix = self._get_gate_matrix(gate)
        target_qubits = sorted(target_qubits, reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order
        for target_qubit in target_qubits:
            gate_matrix = np.kron(np.eye(2**target_qubit), gate_matrix)
            gate_matrix = np.kron(gate_matrix, np.eye(2**(self.num_qubits - target_qubit - 1)))
        self.state = np.dot(gate_matrix, self.state)

    def measure(self, target_qubits):
        probabilities = self._get_probabilities(target_qubits)

        self._update_state(target_qubits, outcome)
        return outcome

    def _get_gate_matrix(self, gate):
        if gate == 'X':
            return np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
        elif gate == 'Y':
            return np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])
        elif gate == 'Z':
            return np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])
        elif gate == 'H':
            return np.array([[1, 1], [1, -1]]) / np.sqrt(2)
        elif gate == 'CNOT':
            return np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]])
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported gate: {}".format(gate))

    def _get_probabilities(self, target_qubits):
        probabilities = np.abs(self.state)**2
        probabilities = np.reshape(probabilities, (2**self.num_qubits,))
        probabilities = np.sum(probabilities.reshape(-1, 2**len(target_qubits))), axis=1)
        return probabilities

    def _update_state(self, target_qubits, outcome):
        outcome_basis = np.binary_repr(outcome, width=len(target_qubits))
        outcome_indices = [int(bit) for bit in outcome_basis]
        mask = np.zeros_like(self.state, dtype=bool)
        for i, target_qubit in enumerate(target_qubits):
            mask |= (1 << (self.num_qubits - target_qubit - 1)) * outcome_indices[i]
        self.state[mask] = 0.0
        self.state /= np.linalg.norm(self.state)

# Example usage of the QuantumSimulator
simulator = QuantumSimulator(2)
simulator.apply_gate('H', [0])  # Apply Hadamard gate on qubit 0
simulator.apply_gate('CNOT', [0, 1])  # Apply CNOT gate on qubits 0 and 1
measurement = simulator.measure([0, 1])  # Measure qubits 0 and 1
print("Measurement outcome:", measurement)
```

This code defines a `QuantumSimulator` class that can simulate quantum circuits and operations. It allows you to create a quantum circuit, apply quantum gates, and measure qubits. The example usage demonstrates the creation of a simple quantum circuit with a Hadamard gate and a CNOT gate, followed by a measurement of qubits 0 and 1. The measurement outcome is then printed.

Please note that this is a simulator and not a physical implementation of quantum computing. It provides a way to experiment and understand quantum algorithms without requiring actual quantum hardware.

Usage example:

```python
# Create a neural network
network = NeuralNetwork(input_size=784, output_size=10)

# Add layers to the network
network.add_layer(FullyConnectedLayer(input_size=784, output_size=128))
network.add_layer(RecurrentLayer(input_size=128, hidden_size=64))
network.add_layer(FullyConnectedLayer(input_size=64, output_size=10))

# Load and preprocess the dataset
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = load_dataset()
X_train = preprocess_data(X_train)
X_test = preprocess_data(X_test)
y_train = preprocess_labels(y_train)
y_test = preprocess_labels(y_test)

# Train the network
network.train(X_train, y_train, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=10)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = network.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions
accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

Note: The code provided is a basic implementation of a neural network with support for fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and recurrent layers. It assumes the existence of functions like `load_dataset()`, `preprocess_data()`, and `preprocess_labels()` for loading and preprocessing the dataset. You may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case and dataset.

## Cost Function 

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the cost function to be optimized
def cost_function(x):
    # Perform quantum operations to calculate the cost
    # ...
    # Calculate the cost based on the quantum results
    cost = ...
    return cost

# Define the gradient function for the cost function
def gradient_function(x):
    # Perform quantum operations to calculate the gradient
    # ...
    # Calculate the gradient based on the quantum results
    gradient = ...
    return gradient

# Initialize the optimization algorithm
x0 = np.random.randn(num_parameters)  # Initial parameter values
method = 'L-BFGS-B'  # Optimization method
options = {'disp': True}  # Additional options for the optimization method

# Perform the hybrid quantum-classical optimization
result = minimize(cost_function, x0, method=method, jac=gradient_function, options=options)

# Get the optimized parameters
optimized_parameters = result.x

# Use the optimized parameters for neural network training or other machine learning tasks
# ...
```

In this code, we define a cost function and a gradient function that leverage quantum operations to calculate the cost and gradient, respectively. These functions can be customized based on the specific quantum capabilities and optimization requirements.

We then initialize the optimization algorithm by specifying the initial parameter values, the optimization method (e.g., 'L-BFGS-B'), and any additional options. The `minimize` function from the `scipy.optimize` library is used to perform the hybrid quantum-classical optimization. The `jac` parameter is set to the gradient function to enable gradient-based optimization.

After the optimization process, we obtain the optimized parameters (`optimized_parameters`) that can be used for neural network training or other machine learning tasks.

Please note that this code assumes the availability of appropriate quantum computing and optimization libraries that provide the necessary quantum operations and optimization methods. The specific implementation details may vary depending on the quantum computing platform and optimization techniques used.
